Read the claude.md root file before you do anything.

Always use:
- context7 for up to date documentation on third party code
- sequential thinking mcp for any decision making
- use the serena mcp server to get the information on the project 
- DO NOT WRITE TRY-CATCH STATEMENTS
- NEVER CONSIDER BACK-COMPATABILITY WHEN WRITING CODE
- YOU DONT CARE ABOUT LEGACY-FUNCTIONS functionality while creating pl√∂ans oder writing code
- LESS CODE IS BETTER: TRY TO WRITE CODE THAT DOES THE JOB WITHOUT ADDING ANYTHING ELSE THAN ASKED FOR

If you encouter requests for for directories that you can not see using serena, use bash for lookups

Rules for created notebooks:
- dont use unnecessary print statements. If you use print statements than only to show information about created variables, their values and other usefull information that a data scientist would like to know.
